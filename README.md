Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

It is the systematic application of engneering principals, methods and tool to develop and maintain high-quality software.
It is important in technology industry because it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of morden life i.e communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1 Development of programming languages
2 Establishment of software engneering as a principal in the 1960s
3 The rise of the methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements - Gathering and documantery of user needs
Design - Creation of high leve and detailed design of the software architecuter and user interface
Implementation - Write code and build the software according to the design specification
Test - Conduct various test to ensure software meets quality standards and functional requirements
Deployment - Release the software customer and users
Maintanance - Provide on-going support, upadates and enhancements to the software

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

 Waterfall - is a sequential approach with distinct phases  flowing downwards like a waterfall. Example requirements comes first followed by design then implementation.
 Agile - is a iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer -  write codes and implements software solution.
Quality Assurance Engineer - ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager - oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments - provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code. Example Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA.
Version Control Systems - software tools that track changes of source code and coordinating work among team members Example Git, Subversion.

 s
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1 Changing Requirements
2 Tight Deadlines
3 Technical Debt

Strategies to overcome these challenges:
It is important to have effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1 Unit Testing- testing of individual components or modules of software'
2 Integration Testing = testing of interactions between different components or subsystems.
3 System Testing - testing of the entire software system as a whole.
4 Acceptance Testing - testing of the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

 Their importance in software quality assurance is to help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the engneering or crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
Its importance is that it helps improve the interaction between humans and AI.



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt: "Search for Houses that are For sale".
Improved prompt: "Search for Houses that are For sale in South Africa around Pretoria range from R300 000 to R800 000"

The improved prompt is effective because is more specific in items of which country to search houses in, location and the price range. Therefore the AI agent will only search for houses in the specified location instead of searching all over the world.
